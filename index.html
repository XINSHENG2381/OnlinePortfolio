        <p>Description:</p>
        <p>This is an amazing project about developing a mobilizable and remote-controllable robot. Starting from the original scratch, developing the CAD model and polishing details, 3D printing the designed parts, boxing all components, tuning the remote control program, testing robot gaits again and again... Here comes our Nutcracker robot. Its moving speed can reach 4 cm/sec. Enjoy the journey!</p>

        <h3>Classical Machine Learning: Navigation Agent inside a 2D maze (Feb 2022)</h3>
        <p><b>Course: Robot Learning</b></p> 
        <p><img class = "project" src="img/RL1.GIF" alt="RL_project1" style="height:350px;"></p>
        <p>Description:</p>
        <p>The image above shows the simulation world. The "robot" (also called "agent") is shown by the green dot. The goal location is shown by the red square. The aim of the agent is to navigate to the goal.
            I first carried out linear regression to infer the relative position of the agent. Then, classification algorithm is used to train low-dimensional behavior data and generate prediction models with three output types. After that, I conducted principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the diemensionality of the visual observation dataset, and trained the model with classification algorithm. The trained prediction model has an accuracy of more than 99% (1-MSE).</p>

        <p>Description:</p>
        <p>I wrote a genetic algorithm to approximately solve the Euclidian Traveling salesman Problem. The program aims at finding the shortest closed path that goes through all points exactly once, and returns to the starting point. I attempted to use a variety of representation, variation operators, selection mechanism in order to reach a better performance, which can be shown on the learning curve compared with other algorithms.</p>

        <p>Description: </p>
        <p>This project used genetic programming to perform symbolic regression. The goal is to find the symbolic algebraic expression of the form y=f(x) best fits a set of 1000 (x,y) pairs. Assume only algebraic operators (+, –, *, /), sine and cosine, and as terminals assume real constants (in the range ±10) and the variable x. I represented a symbolic expression consisting of all the variables and operaters above in a specified structure, which is also known as a binary tree. Then I improved the symbolic expression by minimazing MAE with the target expression to obtain the best fitness and symbolic expression using GA after 50000 times of evaluations, along with adjusting the parameters to reach the best effect.</p>

        <p>Description: </p>
        <p>This project aims at experiencing and practing the application of evolutionary computation to a real world open-ended problem. I created a physics simulator for bouncing and breathing cube robots and animated the motion of robots with open3D. Then I introduced genetic algorithm to evolve an arbitrarily-shaped robot with my own representation, parameters, and metrics. In the end, I evolved the fastest robot that I could.</p>

        <p>In this project, I co-operated in designing a wheelchair-attachable robotic arm to assist the disability to grasp books away from reachable area in libraries, built the robot model and conducted force analysis with SOLIDWORKS.
            When I obtained the solution to forward kinematics and inverse kinematics founded on Denavit-Hartenberg coordinate system, and verified the solution with dynamic simulation using MATLAB toolbox.
            Finally, we concluded the work in the final paper using IEEE format and made a presentation</p>

        <p>Description:</p>
        <p>This is a software-driven fabrication project. I wrote a program that would generate parts for making an acrylic box. The input parameters to the program specify the outside dimensions of the box, material thickness, and any other relevant parameters of a desired. Then my software could generate an SVG file, which could then be imported into the laser-cutter software and used to cut provided acrylic sheets, which should then be bolted into a box.</p>

        <h3>Inverse Bending Problem of Magneto-active Soft Beam Based on Genetic Algorithm (Jun 2021)</h3>
        <p><b>Undergraduate Thesis</b></p> 
        <p><img class = "project" src="img/Thesis.GIF" alt="Thesis_GIF" style="height:400px;"></p>
        <p>Description:</p>
        <p>My thesis provided a numerical approach to predict residual magnetic flux density with a given curve shape of a magneto-active soft beam by applying Genetic Algorithm as the optimization stratgy. The basic examples of inverse bending problems of magnetic beams are solved in continuous domain, discrete domain and mixed integer domain respectively. This thesis also designed application scenarios by solving the inverse problem. It not only provides an effective tool for the efficient design and optimization of magneto-active soft materials and magnetic fields, but also widens the application potential of magneto-active soft materials. </p>

        <p>Description: </p>
        <p>This Javascript-based game is inspired by the movie Interstellar(2014). The game is a space odyssey of an astronaut travelling through a bunch of planets, wormholes and particle storm, and return to the homeland Earth eventually. In space, the motion of the astronaut is decided by the external gravity from all kinds of celestial bodies. However, the player can press the space keyboard so that the astronaut can tempoarily get rid of the effect of gravity and keep moving straightly. Start the game and let us see where it goes!</p>
